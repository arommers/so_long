  <h1>So Long</h1>

My very first graphical project! Creating a 2d topdown game in C as part of my coding journey at CODAM
So long exposed me to the following subjects of programming and helped me develop and improve my skills.: window management,
event handling, textures, and so forth.
You are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was
developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images
and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
