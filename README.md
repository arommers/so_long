  <h1>So Long</h1>
</div>

My very first graphical project! Creating a 2d topdown game in C as part of my coding journey at [CODAM](https://www.codam.nl)/ [NETWORK 42](https://www.42network.org/).

Through "so long" I was introduced to the basics of the following areas of programming: window management, event handling, textures, and so forth. All areas which were instrumental in helping me improve my programming skills and knowledge. Since starting with programming, every step of the learning progress was as rewarding as it was frustrating. Running code to make something visually appear on screen however, was nothing short of exhilarating.

To handle the window management and all things graphical during our project we were tasked to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX or [MLX42](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42)*. These libraries were developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events. Learning how to navigate this library and properly utilize it was a major part of bringing the project to a succesful end.

<sub>* If you are reading this as a 42 student make sure that your particular school actually allows the use of the MLX42 library.</sub>

## Installation

To install the game [download](https://github.com/arommers/so_long/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and use the command 'cd' to move to the so_long folder.

Run 'make' to compile all the files and run the executable './so_long' followed by the pathway to the Maps folder and a map of your choosing.

```
./so_long ./Maps/map1.ber
```
